# Big Data Analytics in Smart Cities: Crime Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the application of **Big Data Analytics** in **Smart Cities** through the analysis of large-scale urban crime data.  
The dataset contains **1,417,653 crime records (2019–2024)** sourced from the Chicago Open Data Portal.

The objective of the project is to demonstrate how big data techniques can be used to extract meaningful insights that support **urban safety, policing strategies, and data-driven decision-making**.
